# Legal Disclaimer

**READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SOFTWARE**

## Not Legal Advice

This software (the "Tool") is provided for **informational and research purposes only**. It does **NOT** constitute professional legal advice, and must not be relied upon as a substitute for professional legal counsel.

### What This Means

- **No Attorney-Client Relationship**: Use of this Tool does not create an attorney-client relationship
- **No Professional Responsibility**: The authors and contributors assume no professional responsibility for decisions made based on information from this Tool
- **Verification Required**: ALL legal information, citations, and conclusions must be independently verified with official sources and qualified legal professionals before being relied upon

## Professional Use Warnings

### For Legal Professionals

If you are a lawyer, legal researcher, or other legal professional:

- **Malpractice Risk**: Relying on unverified information from this Tool in professional legal work may constitute professional malpractice
- **Professional Obligations**: You remain solely responsible for verifying all citations, statutes, and legal positions before advising clients or filing documents
- **Barreau de Luxembourg Rules**: Members of the Luxembourg Bar must comply with professional secrecy and confidentiality rules when using AI tools (see [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md))
- **Client Disclosure**: Consider whether professional ethics rules require disclosing AI tool use to clients

### Duty of Independent Verification

**YOU MUST VERIFY EVERYTHING.** Do not cite, quote, or rely on any provision, case law, or legal interpretation from this Tool without:

1. Checking the official source at **Legilux** (https://legilux.public.lu/)
2. Verifying the provision is currently in force and has not been amended
3. Reading the full context of cited provisions
4. Consulting case law and preparatory works (travaux préparatoires) for interpretation
5. Considering how recent legal developments may affect the matter

## Data Authority and Limitations

### Source Authority

| Source | Authority Level | Use Case |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Legilux** | Official government portal | Statute text (authoritative) |
| **SPARQL / Akoma Ntoso** | Structured official data | Machine-readable legislation |

**CRITICAL**: While Legilux is the official Luxembourg legislation portal, this Tool's ingestion process may introduce transcription errors, miss recent amendments, or have incomplete coverage. Always cross-check with the official portal.

### Commercial Legal Databases

For professional legal work, **always cross-check with authoritative sources** such as:

- **Legilux** (https://legilux.public.lu/) — official legislation portal
- **Legiconsult** — Luxembourg legal research platform
- **Strada lex Luxembourg** — commercial legal database

## Currency and Staleness

### No Real-Time Updates

- Database updates are **manual** and may lag official publications by **weeks or months**
- Luxembourg law changes through new statutes, amendments (lois modificatives), and grand-ducal regulations (règlements grand-ducaux)
- **Last-updated timestamps** in tool responses indicate data age, but should be treated as approximate

### Amendments and Repeals

- A provision marked "in force" may have been:
  - Amended after the last database update
  - Repealed but not yet removed from the database
  - Subject to transitional rules affecting its applicability
- The Tool does **NOT** automatically track amendments in real-time

## Coverage Gaps

### What May Be Missing

This Tool may not include:

1. **Grand-Ducal Regulations** — Coverage may be limited to primary legislation (lois)
2. **Full EU Law Text** — Only EU cross-reference metadata; full directive/regulation text not available
3. **CJEU Case Law** — Court of Justice rulings binding on Luxembourg courts not included
4. **Historical Statute Versions** — Limited availability of historical provision wording
5. **Legal Commentary** — No editorial annotations or doctrine
6. **Unpublished Decisions** — Lower court and administrative tribunal decisions largely absent
7. **Legislative History** — Limited coverage of travaux préparatoires
